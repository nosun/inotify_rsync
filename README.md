### Inotify / Rsync script

Originally implemented to sync specified folder between multiple AWS EC2 instances.
But I believe can be adopted for the general 'Watch - Sync' approach between servers.

Prerequisite:

* inotify-tools
* rsync
* ssh

Also some extra configuration required. Will be explained shortly.
